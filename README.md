# Potluck-Planner

## Description

We are very pleased to bring you this completed web application project. This application allows users to easily plan and coordinate a potluck dinner with friends without needing to constantly communicate with other guests about what to bring. Instead of something clunky like a shared excel file on a google drive, this application allows the user to upload their dish, and return later to see what others are bringing if they so choose. Finally, the user will be presented with an image of the dish, because as well all know, you eat with your eyes first!

## Installation

There is no installation required for this web application, simply follow the link to the deployed web page. Alternatively the user can copy this repo onto their local device, run npm install to install the necessary dependencies, followed by npm start in the command line.

## Usage

Using this application is quite simple. If it is a users first time visiting the page, they must fill out the sign up form. From there they can click “Your Dishes” in the top right corner of the page to view what they have already uploaded, or to upload the first dish that they plan to bring. If the user clicks the title in the top left corner, they will be taken to a list of everything that has already been uploaded and by whom. The user can logout and return to the page at a later date if they so choose as well.

## Demo

A demo was given during the class presentation, however if you would prefer to toy around with the back end yourself, simply follow the second set of instructions in the installation section of this document.

## License
